# landing-page
An iteration of the Odin Project "landing page" assignment. I decided to create a very basic webpage for the best girl, my pup, Fiera.
Skills developed:
- Practised using flexbox.
- Learnt and used a CSS reset.
- Used GIT to track and update the project.
- Started developing an awareness of semantic HTML.

Need to work on:
- Properly using classes and IDs.
- Developing for mobile.
- Making code more succinct.
